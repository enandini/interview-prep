# interview-prep
I'm not that great at technical interviews. Here's a repository that'll help me become better at it.

### What you'll find
1. Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Leetcode solutions
3. Useful tips I find throughout the web
4. Other stuff

I like C++, so that's the language I'll be using throughout this repository.
